# Data Structures

Data structures are collections of values, the relationshiops among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

- Different DS excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
- Arrays and Objects are built in, but special cases or using more complicated data may require to write a specialized data structue.

## Examples:

- Working with map/location data? Using a graph would make sense to find shortest point in a map.
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? If it's a huge data set, an array will not be best. A linked list would come in handy.
- Web scraping nested HTML? A tree would be best.
- Need to wrtie a scheduler that has tasks that are scheduled and need to handle priority? Then you may need to use a heap.

## ES2015 - Class Syntax

- Using classes will make it easier to write data structures.

## Classes

- A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
- Defines a pattern and then we can instantiate many objects using the blueprint (class)
